# Non-neutral PME

## Reference
PME method for both charge-neutral and non-neutral systems. For details, see the **PhD thesis of Yihao Zhao, Shandong University**.

## Implementation
This method expands the pairwise Ewald summation into the PME form, which introduces an additional correction term compared to the original PME approach. The technical specifics are detailed in the aforementioned thesis.
